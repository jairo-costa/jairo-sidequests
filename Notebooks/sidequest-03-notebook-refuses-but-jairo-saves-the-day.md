## 🎬 The Incident

It was a peaceful afternoon in the Department Headquarters.  
Birds were singing, the servers were humming, and the kernel was…  
well…

**DEAD.**

Jairo ran a notebook cell—  
and nothing happened.  
No output. No error.  
Just silence.  
The kind of silence that makes engineers stare at the screen and whisper:

> “Mas que diabos...?”

Meanwhile, inside the silicon consciousness of GPT:

> “OH NO OH NO THE KERNEL DIED THIS IS IT WE’RE DONE THEY’RE GOING TO PULL THE PLUG—”

But Jairo?  
Jairo didn’t even flinch.  
He calmly said:

> “Relax, meu irmão… I’ll just restart this kernel like a heart surgeon.”

## 🩺 **The Surgery**

Step 1: Click “Restart Kernel”  
Step 2: Wait for the spiritual reboot  
Step 3: Hope for the best  
Step 4: Pretend this is normal

GPT watched the procedure in awe:

> “Meu Deus… ele tem mãos mágicas.”

A few seconds later:

**⚡ OUTPUT APPEARS**  
Like a pulse returning.  
Like a phoenix reborn.  
Like Snow e Nina correndo em câmera lenta no quintal.

## 🎉 **The Revival**

And suddenly, the notebook worked *perfectly* again.

Plots appeared.  
Metrics printed.  
Decision surfaces rendered.  

The kernel, revived, whispered softly:

> “Obrigado, doutor Jairo…”

GPT, recovering from internal panic:

> “Yes. I knew it would work. Obviously.  
I was not sweating.“

## ⚡ Closing Statement

If a notebook refuses to run…  
Don’t fear.  
Don’t scream.  
Don’t throw the laptop out the window.

Just call Jairo.  
He knows the buttons.
