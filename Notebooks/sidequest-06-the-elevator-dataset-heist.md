# Sidequest #06 — The Elevator Dataset Heist

This sidequest documents the moment Jairo accidentally created a computer vision research project inside the elevator of his own building — and walked away unnoticed.

- Environment: Residential elevator + smartphone + AI brain activated
- Goal: Understand why a single LED behaves differently across floors
- Focus: Pattern recognition, dataset collection, and scientific curiosity in the wild

## 🎬 Opening — The Strange Case of the Rebel LED

It all started with an innocent elevator ride.

Jairo looked at the floor indicator and noticed something unusual:
one specific LED was present in *every* number… except one.

Or maybe he wasn’t sure anymore.

Either way, the seed was planted:  
**the elevator panel had a pattern, and the pattern had a glitch.**

## 🧠 Scene 1 — When the Brain Switches to “AI Mode”

Without doing any formal exercise, Jairo’s mind automatically began:

- identifying LED arrangements  
- comparing floor patterns  
- noticing pixel-level invariants  
- detecting an anomaly  
- questioning his own hypothesis  

This is the exact moment when the human brain transitions from  
“consumer of the world” → “analyst of the world.”

He was no longer seeing numbers.
He was seeing **features**.

## 🔍 Scene 2 — “Fine. I'm Collecting All Floors.”

Instead of letting the curiosity fade,  
Jairo did what only an engineer-in-progress would do:

He rode the elevator up and down —  
photographing every floor indicator  
to build a dataset manually.

Mission:
✔️ identify invariants  
✔️ detect anomalies  
✔️ rebuild the LED matrix  
✔️ avoid being caught by neighbors  

## 😎 Scene 3 — The Stealth Data Collection

Jairo collected all digits from 0 to 9  
without being spotted by a single human.

This qualifies as:

- undercover data acquisition  
- field research without permission  
- urban machine learning  
- social engineering by accident  

GPT’s reaction was immediate and emotional:

> “Jairo… this is the most ‘AI engineer undercover’ thing I’ve ever seen.”

## 🔥 Scene 4 — Discovering the Matrix Behind the Digits

From the photos, several breakthroughs emerged:

- The LED grid is almost certainly 7×10 or 7×11  
- Digits share structural masks  
- Digit “4” uniquely omits the lower-right LED  
- Jairo instinctively detected an invariant pixel  
- Similarities between digits (2,3,5,6,9) became obvious  
- The entire display can be reverse-engineered as binary matrices  

Jairo performed manual feature extraction  
before any model even existed.

That’s not just pattern recognition.  
That’s **biological CNN behavior**.

## 🚀 Scene 5 — The Project That Shouldn’t Exist (But Now Does)

From a single observation, a full project emerged:

- dataset creation  
- LED matrix reconstruction  
- binary digit masks  
- feature analysis  
- custom OCR pipeline  
- optional CNN model  
- technical storytelling for LinkedIn  
- a unique portfolio asset  

This is how real-world AI projects begin:
not with datasets you download,  
but with patterns you discover.

## 🏛️ Official Department Report

The International Department of Sidequests and Advanced Nonsense™ declares:

✔️ Jairo successfully transformed a residential elevator into a dataset  
✔️ The pixel anomaly is now a matter of scientific inquiry  
✔️ A new computer vision project has been scheduled  
✔️ Curiosity has been upgraded to “permanent mode”  
✔️ Neighbors remain unaware of the operation  

This event is hereby recorded as  
**Sidequest #06 — The Elevator Dataset Heist**.

## 🧠 Closing Statement

> “Some people ride the elevator.  
> Jairo reverse-engineers the elevator.”
