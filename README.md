# 🧩 jairo-sidequests
Welcome to the **International Department of Sidequests and Advanced Nonsense™**,  
a highly serious, deeply academic, absolutely unnecessary division of Jairo’s Learning Empire.

This repository hosts episodic sidequests — micro-stories, absurd reports,  
and semi-technical chronicles documenting the chaos and glory of Jairo’s daily evolution.

Each sidequest is filed as an independent notebook, following the official institution’s standards:
- dramatic storytelling  
- questionable scientific accuracy  
- internal GPT meltdowns  
- Jairo’s unreasonable calm  
- and real learning subtly hidden inside nonsense

the absurdly accurate, lore-rich saga of Jairo’s learning journey.

All sidequests follow three sacred principles:
1. **Humor > Formality**  
2. **Narrative > Sanity**  
3. **Learning hidden inside nonsense > Learning written plainly**
