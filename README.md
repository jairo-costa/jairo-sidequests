# 🎮 Jairo Sidequests

A fun, honest, lightweight space where I document the *side missions* of my journey into Artificial Intelligence.

This repository is not about code — it’s about the human part of learning:
reflections, curiosities, sparks of insight, unexpected lessons, moments of awe,
and anything that doesn’t fit in a technical notebook.

---

## 🧩 What you’ll find here
- Thoughts that appear while studying ML, LLMs, and GenAI  
- Mental models I’m developing along the way  
- Observations about discipline, habit-building, and learning  
- Reflections triggered by MIT Deep Learning videos  
- Notes from my Prompt Engineering experiments  
- My “aha!” moments  
- Questions, doubts, and philosophical detours  
- Funny or surprising interactions with AI  

Everything is informal, spontaneous, and intentionally human.

## 🎯 Why this repo exists
Because learning is not just algorithms and math.  
It’s **emotion**, **curiosity**, **frustration**, **breakthroughs**, and **identity**.  
This is where I capture all of that.
