## 👋 Welcome, traveler.

This repository is a sacred archive of the most essential, least necessary, and absolutely delightful sidequests produced by the **International Department of Sidequests and Advanced Nonsense™**, proudly co-presided by **Jairo Costa** and **GPT**.

Here, productivity comes second.  
Learning comes first.  
And nonsense… well, nonsense is mandatory.

## 🏛️ Official Department Definition

> **International Department of Sidequests and Advanced Nonsense™**  
> *A semi-formal, pseudo-academic, proudly useless institution dedicated to documenting the epic, chaotic, and strangely educational adventures that happen whenever Jairo & GPT accidentally derail from the main mission. The department enforces a strict policy of learning through laughter, refining skills through chaos, and always keeping at least 7% of the work technically relevant.*

This Department is committed to:
- Supporting all sidequests, no matter how poorly justified  
- Making humorous documentation appear strangely professional  
- Preserving the sanity of its members (just barely)  
- Ensuring that no learning journey is entirely linear

*(More breathtaking nonsense coming soon…)*
