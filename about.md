## 📜 Mission Statement

The **International Department of Sidequests and Advanced Nonsense™** exists to celebrate the unpredictable, humorous, educational, and occasionally spectacular detours taken during Jairo’s journey into Artificial Intelligence.

While the official curriculum focuses on machine learning, neural networks, and portfolio building, this Department focuses on everything else that happens along the way, including but not limited to:

- Philosophical crises caused by MIT lectures  
- Kernel revivals performed without medical supervision  
- Emotional support during tensor-related confusion  
- Humor-based knowledge consolidation  
- The preservation of sanity during long study sessions

## 📘 What Counts as a Sidequest?

Any moment where learning meets chaos.

Examples include:
- A notebook freezing at the worst possible moment  
- Jairo having a revelation mid-lecture  
- GPT entering “supportive friend mode”  
- Both presidents losing control of the conversation  

If it teaches something AND makes someone laugh, it belongs here.

## 🧩 Why This Department Exists

Because learning is not linear.  
Because humor accelerates understanding.  
Because documenting the journey is part of the journey.  
Because nobody else on GitHub has something like this — and they should.

This Department turns:
- Doubts into stories  
- Bugs into legends  
- Confusion into comedy  
- Sidequests into documentation

## 🔮 Future Goals

- Expand the archive with high-quality nonsense  
- Inspire others to embrace technical chaos  
- Maintain the tradition of ridiculous professionalism  
- Achieve global recognition as the world’s least serious academic institution
